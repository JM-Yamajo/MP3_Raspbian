# MP3 Player Project

This project is an MP3 player application developed as a scholarly project at ITESM Campus Puebla.

## File Setup

1. **Ensure the MP3.DESKTOP file is on the desktop.**
2. **Move the entire MP3 folder to the following path:**  
   `/home/pi/Documents/TE2003`

1. Click on the `MP3.DESKTOP` file.
2. The program will automatically start playing the first song in the list.
3. Use the following controls:
   - **Play/Pause:** Resume or pause the music.
   - **Stop (Alto):** Stop the music.
   - **Next (Siguiente):** Play the next song in the list.
   - **Previous (Anterior):** Play the previous song in the list.
